                    “Give me few Nation’s peace sensitized and empowered united youths; I will give you a powerful, peaceful, and progressive united nation with security”.
                    WHEREAS sensitized a youth on peace, unity, security and transformation; she/he will sanitized the society in every areas.
                    WHEREAS Empower the youths; they will power and move the Society.
                    WHEREAS the total moves and fights for peace at global and all other levels have about ninety percent (90%) not involved the youths who have hundred percent (100%) strength for violence and hundred percent (100%) strength for talk, and are the very instruments and determinants of the matter of concern (Peace and security), but has about ninety percent (90) involved and concerned with “only” the elders who have only but about twenty percent (20 %) strength for violence and seventy percent strength to talk, that is why most of their discussions and deliberations have not yielded a tangible result, if not yielded any at all in virtually all cases in the fight to initiate peace in the society.
                    WHEREAS Peace and Transformation Youths International Foundation (PTYIF) AKA Young World Changers, Healers and Savers (WYCHS) is committed to bring the youths of the world to the frontier of the fight for peace, unity, security and transformation, and make them actively involved and formidable than the elders because they are the key-players.
                    WHEREAS, since “the Youths are the best evangelizers to youths” according to Pope John Paul II, Peace and Transformation Youths International Foundation (PTYIF) is a conglomerate of peace, unity, security and transformation enlightened and sensitized youths all over the world who have decided to take up the responsibility of sensitizing other youths indebtedly on peace, unity, security and transformation at every level.
                    WHEREAS Peace and Transformation Youths International Foundation (PTYIF) aka Young World Changers, Healers and Savers (WYCHS) is a Foundation found with the specific aim and objectives of bringing out and positively harnessing the potentials in the youths across the world, grooming and culturing them for peace in the World’s fight for peace and transformation, which is the point Sixteen (16) of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focus areas, unity, security, transformation and progress,
                    WHEREAS we know “The Elders have the Authority; but the Youths have the Power and Force”.
<br><br>
                    Every authority needs a power to enforce it; the authority of the elders in the society would be of vain purpose without the power of the youths to put them into action. It therefore means that the youths are the Society Movers, (they have the ability and in the position to determine what moves and does not move in the society by virtue of the power they possess).
                    The elders are wiser than the youths in knowing this, that’s why they entice the youths to get them move the society the way and direction the elders themselves desire.
                    If the youths should be enlightened and sensitized adequately and sufficiently on how they can effectively and efficiently use their powers to move the society towards a direction for the common good of the entire society and themselves, they would not heed or cecum to the deceit of the villainous and nefarious elders.
                    Generally we belief that if only the society can work on the youths; the youths will work for the society; it all depends on the kind of working. So PTYIF stands as a figure of the society to work on the youths positively.
                    Our Foundation’s fight is to displace the inhuman, egocentric and corrupt minded prominent, influential, wealthy and elite politicians, religious and tribal leaders, and members of the society working negatively on our youths.
                    WHEREAS the idea behind the formation was as a result of the persistence Interreligious, Interethnic and Intertribal rivalries, conflicts and violence in Nigeria which regularly claim lives and properties, and generally impedes the progress of the country.
                    It was later deemed necessary for the foundation and its activities to be initiated throughout other countries of the world, since the cause of the Foundation formation is a world problem, and its aims, objectives, vision and mission are the world necessities and solutions.
                    WHEREAS PTYIF seeks to intervene on the peace, security, unity, transformation and progress of countries and the world at large through well planned strategic peaceful and monitoring activities to restore, promote and maintain the above mentioned, and address the attitude of religious, tribal, racial and Faith bigotry. Therefore, the PTYIF Transformation mandate for the world shall be a Peaceful Strategic Change.
                    WHEREAS when we put in appreciable resources for peace in the society today; the society shall give back to us a thousand fold out of peace of what we invested into it for peace.
                    WHEREAS in many countries throughout the world, transformation and progress are impended, passive and unfeasible because of persistence violence perpetuated by the youths, being instigated behind the stage by egoistic vicious and inhuman influential and elite political and religious class and leaders for their personal motives.
                    They succeed to entice and seduce the youths into unscrupulous and callous acts out of the ignorance of the youths, hence there is every need for the youths to be oriented and sensitized about the strategic and diplomatic ways of luring them into these inhuman acts meted against the entire human race by the wrong thinking mind elders. Sensitizing the world youths at various levels (Internationally, Nationally and at various local levels) on the need for peace and how to establish and promote it becomes the priority and core responsibility of (PTYIF) AKA World Young Changers, Healers and Savers (WYCHS)
                    WHEREAS the Foundations hopes to achieve these through partnership with Governmental and Nongovernmental Organizations and bodies at all levels throughout the world.
                    The Foundation shall also partner with these bodies to do all such that is lawful within its ability and provisions to avert and fight against the major causes and reasons for violent acts to establish and promote peace, Transformation, Unity and Progress.
                    In addition to the ignorance of the violent perpetuating youths, Poverty, hunger and starvation are also well established determinant factors stirring up, encouraging and giving purpose for violent actions condoled and demonstrated by the youths throughout the world. Therefore, there is every need that in the WYCHS fight and struggle for peace, PTYIF aka WYCHS shall empower, strengthen, equip and gird financial, skillfully, knowledgably and otherwise in other not to be enticed, seduced and lured into violence as a result of poverty or starvation.
                    WHEREAS in PTYIF fight and struggle for peace, unity and transformation, it shall not only involve the youths, it also shall acknowledge the indispensable joint roles of the elders of right minds and goodwill for the members of the society and human race at large.
                    WHEREAS PTYIF shall be a conglomerate of uncompromised, unsentimental, un-favoritism and unbiased youths from different Religion, tribe, culture, country, continent, race and Faith of integrity, indisputable probity and common ideologies with passion, zeal and determination, who shall come together to bring about feasible and tangible Transformation throughout the world in different aspects of life including social-economical, government, religion and more, and at different geographical areas and the entire world at large.
                    WHEREAS members of PTYIF shall be advocates against bad and callous governance, governments and public leadership and office holders (officials) for a positive change/Transformation, but shall be, and shall support good governments, governance, public leadership and office holders (officials) to help the government to promote and encourage good governance at every level deemed necessary.
                    WHEREAS, in PTYIF Peace shall be treated and considered in two (2) perspectives for the actualization of the general mission and goals of the Organization:
                    as a veritable indispensable tool and as Means towards bringing about positive change/Transformation
                    As an end of the goal and mission of the Organization. Other ends of the goal and mission of the Organization shall include: Security, transformation, unity and progress.
                    WHEREAS in summary, PTYIF hopes to bring about positive change/Transformation via peace, by conducting peaceful: seminars, skills acquisition, capacity building workshops, campaigns, public enlightenment, training, scholarships for studies and training, advocacy, conferences, conventions, rally, interviews and other forms as its mandates, all in a peaceful manner. The above mentioned means and others shall be veritable and indispensable means and tools for actualizing other ends besides peace, which include security, transformation, unity and progress.</div>

              <div class="panel-body">Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are the electronic banking systems that accept players from the United States that wish to play in online casinos.
